Goldbachâ€™s Conjecture (GC) is a well-known unproven mathematical statement. It asserts that every even integer,
 $n\geq 2$ can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Assuming GC holds true, then for any even integer $n$, there exist prime 
 numbers $p$ and $q$ such that $n = p + q$. Let $p_n$ be the smallest prime number for which $q_n= n-p_n$ is also a prime. Define the following functions:
	$\pi(n)$ as the number of primes less than or equal to $n$, $\pi_2(n)$ as the number of twin primes less than or equal to $n$, $F_{k}(x)$ as the number of times that $p_k=x$ for every $6 \leq k \leq n$. Then, the following relationships hold: $\pi(n) = F_n(3)+1$, and $\pi_2(n) =F_n(3)-F_n(5)$

Using the well-known fact that every prime number, except $2$ and $3$, is adjacent to a multiple of $6$ ($p=6k \pm 1 $, where $p$ is prime and $k \ge 1$ is an integer), we have developed a simple and fast algorithm to identify the prime numbers that form the sum.
