Many people have asked me: how does your discovery come about? 
I wish I could claim that it was the fruit of a towering intellect and 
long years spent labouring over Goldbach’s Conjecture—that I endured 
endless nights of calculation, frustration and false starts, until at 
last a flash of insight broke through. But the truth is far quieter than that.

It began less than a year ago, with a dream. The problem presented itself not as a revelation, 
but as the faintest suggestion, lodged somewhere at the back of my mind. The next morning, 
I recalled a familiar fact: every prime p>3 is congruent to either 1 or −1 modulo 6. With that 
simple observation in hand, I wrote a very simple, quick algorithm to compute the minimal Goldbach partitions. 
Then I simply let the numbers run their course. For weeks, I did little more than watch, noting their quiet
rhythms and half-formed patterns. When a few sequences became apparent, I submitted them to the OEIS—not 
with any expectation, but merely because they struck me as curious.

Then came the second dream, which provided the true glimmer of understanding. 
In it, I saw that whenever the number 3 appeared as the least prime in a partition, 
a new prime seemed to join the endless procession of the primes. That simple dream, 
unlikely as it sounds, was the key. Afterwards, I noticed the subtle thread 
linking π(n) and π₂(n) with the minimal Goldbach partitions. 
I checked my figures, and there it was—plain, neat, and quietly satisfying.

And so the “discovery” arrived. No stroke of genius—only two stray dreams, 
a modest little algorithm, and the patience to sit with the numbers until they whispered their secret.

However, I cannot state with certainty whether this constitutes a novel result. 
Its simplicity (and Beauty!) is such that it seems almost a miracle that it has not already 
been discovered. My attempts to locate a reference were unsuccessful. I subsequently consulted 
several number theorists, but those who replied were likewise unfamiliar with it.

My most reasonable conjecture is that it may have been established approximately two centuries ago 
and now lies forgotten, perhaps preserved only in a neglected library, recorded in Latin.
